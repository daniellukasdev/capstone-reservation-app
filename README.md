# Restaurant Reservation App

## Deployed App
- [Restataurant Reservation App](https://restaur-reserve-frontend.herokuapp.com/dashboard)

## Description

A full-stack web application submitted as my final capstone at Thinkful. 

It allows users to: 
- Create, edit, and cancel a reservation
- Create a table, seat a reservation, then clear a table when the reservation party has finished.
- Search for reservations by phone number

The development process showcases the following practices:
- Outside-in Development
- As new features were added, separate branches were created per user story and merged once they were completed.
- Kanban board for keeping track of development progress
